# CIA-Reflection

## Objective

As part of my cybersecurity studies, I completed a project focused on the CIA Triadâ€”a fundamental model in information security encompassing Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

This project involved analyzing real-world applications of the CIA Triad, using a banking system as a case study. I explored how financial institutions implement security measures such as encryption, access controls, hashing, and fault tolerance to safeguard user data. Additionally, I assessed how these principles work together to balance security and accessibility while identifying scenarios where one principle may take precedence over the others.

Through this project, I strengthened my ability to evaluate security controls, assess risks, and apply cybersecurity best practices to protect critical data and systems.
